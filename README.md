# Beako Dashboard

Kivy GUI that display stats about my discord bot [Beako](https://github.com/3nws/beako-bot) in real time with a socket connection. Such as the current number of servers it is in, the number of users it can see, the number of times each command is used for that session, and the contents of those commands (arguments).
